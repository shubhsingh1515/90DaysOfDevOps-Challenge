# 90 Days of DevOps – Personal Learning Plan  

## 1. My Current Level  

I am a working professional with a background in software development (MERN stack & Java).  
I have basic understanding of Linux, Git, cloud concepts and DevOps tools like Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, or cloud infrastructure.  

I consider myself a beginner in DevOps and Cloud Engineering.  

---

## 2. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud  

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that connects development and operations to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better quality.  

It focuses on:  
- Automation  
- Continuous Integration & Deployment  
- Monitoring & reliability  
- Infrastructure as Code  
- Collaboration between teams  

Cloud engineering is about building and managing scalable, secure, and highly available systems using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

## 3. Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud  

I am starting this journey to:  
- Become a complete full-stack + DevOps engineer  
- Improve my career opportunities and salary growth  
- Build production-ready, scalable applications  
- Transition into cloud-native and modern engineering roles  

I want to move beyond just writing code and learn how real systems are deployed, monitored, and maintained in production.

## 4. Where I Want to Reach in 90 Days  

By the end of 90 days, I want to be able to:  

1. Deploy a production-grade application on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes  
2. Build a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins  
3. Monitor and debug applications running in containers and Kubernetes

## 5. My 3 Core DevOps Skills to Build  

1. Linux & system troubleshooting  
2. CI/CD pipeline design and automation  
3. Containerization & Kubernetes debugging  

---

## 6. Weekly Time Commitment  

Weekdays: 2 – 2.5 hours per day  
Weekends: 4 – 5 hours per day  

Total: ~15–18 hours per week  

I will focus on consistency over perfection. Even on busy days, I will spend at least 30–45 minutes learning or practicing.  

---

## 7. How I Will Stay Consistent  

- Follow the TrainWithShubham roadmap strictly  
- Learn in public by sharing progress on LinkedIn  
- Maintain daily notes and GitHub commits  
- Avoid skipping more than one day in a row  
- Focus on small daily progress instead of big goals  

---

## 8. My Commitment  

I commit to showing up every day for the next 90 days.  
I understand that discipline and consistency matter more than motivation.  

This challenge is my personal execution blueprint to become a DevOps engineer.
